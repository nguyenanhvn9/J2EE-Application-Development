# API Testing Guide

## Test the Fixed Book API

After fixing the database column length issues, test the API with these steps:

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Test API Endpoints

#### Test 1: Check Status (should return false initially)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/books/status
```
Expected: `"Books loaded: false"`

#### Test 2: Get All Books (triggers lazy loading)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/books
```
Expected: JSON array of books fetched from Gutenberg API

#### Test 3: Check Status Again (should return true)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/books/status
```
Expected: `"Books loaded: true"`

#### Test 4: Get Books Again (should return from database)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/books
```
Expected: Same books as before, but loaded from database (faster response)

#### Test 5: Manual Fetch
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/books/fetch
```
Expected: `"Books fetched successfully from Gutenberg API"`

#### Test 6: Clear Books
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/books/clear
```
Expected: `"Books cleared successfully"`

### 3. Monitor Console Output

Watch the console for these messages:
- "Fetching books from Gutenberg API..."
- "Successfully fetched and saved X books from API"

### 4. Database Verification

Access H2 Console at: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- Username: `sa`
- Password: `password`

Query to check books:
```sql
SELECT * FROM books;
```

## Expected Results

✅ No more "Value too long for column" errors  
✅ Books are successfully fetched and stored  
✅ Lazy loading works correctly  
✅ All API endpoints respond properly  
✅ Database contains properly formatted book data  

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:
1. Check that the application.properties has the correct database configuration
2. Verify all imports are present in BookService.java
3. Ensure the H2 dependency is in pom.xml
4. Restart the application after any changes
